# Age Calculator Web App
This is a modern and responsive Age Calculator web application. It allows users to input their Date of Birth and calculates their exact age in years, months, and days.

The project is built using:

HTML5 for the structure and layout

CSS3 for styling, animations, and responsive design

TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript) for the logic and interactivity

# Features
Accurate age calculation based on the current date

Input validation for empty or future dates

Custom alert messages for better user feedback

Loading animation while processing

Confetti celebration effect after successful calculation

Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop views

# Developer Notes
The core logic is written in TypeScript to take advantage of type safety and maintainable code. The TypeScript file (script.ts) is compiled into JavaScript (script.js) using the TypeScript compiler. All DOM interactions, visual effects, and input handling are managed through this script.

# About the Project
